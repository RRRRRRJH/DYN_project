Toolboxes: Stateflow, Robotics toolbox

singleAGVSimpleModel is the stateflow plant model assuming only one AGV, it has AGV chart which has
all the possible states for the AGV: Initial position, storage, Red& blue, Yellow& black, mixing station and invalidTransition
The transition times are considered constant and can be found in the model explorer
The Mixing chart has 2 state: on and off for the mixer. The transition between them is done through message sent from AGV chart.
Red and black chart has 3 states: filling black, filling yellow or no filling. The transition again is done through message sent from AGV chart.
The same goes for yellow and black chart. 
The input to the AGV chart is a square signal and each number represents a station.
It is written inside the file itself which number is which station.

FourAGVsFullModle 
is the full stateflow model of the plant with 4 AGVs. 
 The difference was adding stationBusy state in every AGV chart. Every thing else is the same

AGVsTrajectory is the simulink model for live trajectory plot. 
It takes the input from the excel sheet AGVs.
newmap is the map of te plant and use in AGVplot file.
AGVplotfile is matlab code that takes the positions as output from AGVsTrajectory simulink model
and plots them.
